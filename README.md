## Tutorial--First-Neural-Network-With-Keras
In this tutorial, you will learn how to build your first neural network model from scratch using the powerful Keras Python library.

Specifically, step-by-step we will tackle:

- How to load data?
- How to define neural network in Keras?
- How to compile a Keras model using the efficient numerical backend?
- How to train a model on data?
- How to evaluate a model on data?
